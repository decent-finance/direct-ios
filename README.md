## Requirements

* Swift 5
* iOS 11

## Installation

You can use CocoaPods or download and link with the framework manually. Support for Carthage will be added soon.

### CocoaPods

pod 'CEXDirect'

## Usage

You must receive your placement ID and secret to be able to integrate the framework into your application.

Example of usage:

```
  let cexDirect = CEXDirect(placementID: "your_placement_id", secret: "your_placement_secret")
  if let rootViewController = cexDirect.rootViewController {
      present(rootViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
  }  
```

You can also find a demo application inside the project. To make it work you should set your placement ID and secret in the Placement.plist file.
